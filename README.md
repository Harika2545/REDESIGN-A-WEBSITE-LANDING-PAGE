##  **Task Description – CODTECH Internship Task 1: Website Landing Page Redesign**

The goal of this internship task was to redesign an existing website landing page to enhance its usability, visual appeal, and overall user experience. A landing page serves as the first interaction point between a brand and its potential customers, and therefore, it must be both aesthetically pleasing and functionally effective. The redesign process focused on improving navigation, layout, typography, color harmony, and responsiveness, ensuring a modern and user-centered interface.

For this task, a **Coffee Shop Landing Page** was selected as the base example. The original design was simple but outdated, with a cluttered layout, poor color contrast, and no clear calls-to-action. The objective was to transform it into a visually engaging, easy-to-navigate, and responsive webpage that attracts users and encourages them to explore further or make a purchase.

### **Tools Used**

The redesign process incorporated several tools commonly used in UI/UX design workflows:

1. **Figma:** The primary design tool used to create wireframes, visual layouts, and interactive mockups. Figma’s collaborative interface made it easy to experiment with typography, color palettes, and layout spacing.
2. **Canva:** Used for creating visually appealing banners, icons, and mockup visuals for presentation purposes.
3. **Adobe Color Wheel:** Utilized to generate a harmonious and modern color palette consisting of warm coffee tones, beige, and soft orange highlights.
4. **Google Fonts (Poppins & Lato):** Implemented to enhance readability and maintain a clean, professional appearance.
5. **ReportLab (Python Library):** Used to compile the final documentation and visual comparison into a professional PDF report for submission.

### **Design Process**

The redesign process followed a structured **UI/UX workflow**:

1. **Research & Analysis:** The first step involved analyzing the original website layout to identify usability issues. It was noted that the original design lacked visual hierarchy, had weak typography, and did not highlight key user actions like “Order Now.”
2. **Wireframing:** Low-fidelity sketches were created in Figma to plan the new structure, ensuring a logical flow of content from header to footer.
3. **Visual Design:** The redesigned version introduced a clean, modern layout with ample white space, improved color contrast, and visually appealing imagery. Key sections included a Hero Banner, About Us, Menu Highlights, Testimonials, and Footer.
4. **Prototype Creation:** Interactive elements such as navigation buttons and CTA highlights were added in Figma to visualize user interactions.
5. **Responsive Design:** The layout was optimized for both desktop and mobile users, ensuring consistency across devices.

### **Key Improvements**

* A clear **navigation bar** was added for intuitive browsing.
* **Call-to-action buttons** such as “Explore Menu” and “Order Now” were prominently placed.
* **High-quality images** replaced dull visuals to capture attention.
* **Consistent typography** improved readability and modernized the brand image.
* **Testimonials and highlights** were added to improve trust and engagement.

### **Outcome**

The redesigned Coffee Shop Landing Page successfully delivers a modern and engaging digital experience. It demonstrates an understanding of key UI/UX principles — simplicity, consistency, accessibility, and user focus. The project also showcases the use of professional tools like **Figma**, **Canva**, and **ReportLab**, reflecting a complete design-to-documentation workflow.
